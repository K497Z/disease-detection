The spots are scattered across the leaf, with some concentrated in clusters. The leaf has a smooth surface with a slightly waxy texture. The edges of the leaf are serrated, and there are no visible damages such as holes, tears, or wilting. The veins on the leaf are thin and green, and they are distributed throughout the leaf. The petiole of the leaf is thin and green, with a slightly rough texture."

The surface of the leaf is smooth. The petiole is thin and green, with a visible vein running down its center. There are no visible damages, such as holes, tears, or wilting. The leaf is attached to a stem that is not visible in the image."
